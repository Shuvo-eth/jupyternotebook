    "Suppose a portfolio manager at a financial institution is managing three separate accounts. The portfolio manager has purchased three different Tech stocks for each of his clients; Bill, Sundar and Tim. He purchased these stocks at the same time, which means the stocks for each company were purchased at the same price. The portfolio manager purchased 1 Apple stock, 5 Microsoft stocks and 3 Google stocks for a combined price of $2,450 for his client Bill. The portfolio manager has also purchased 2 Apple stocks, 3 Microsoft stocks and 1 Google stock for a total price of $1,550 for his client Sundar. And finally, he purchased 3 Apple stocks, 2 Microsoft stocks, and 1 Google stock for a total of $1,450 for his client Tim. Given the following three systems of equations, find the price of each stock at the time of purchase.  \n"
